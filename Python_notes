The two subroutines, placed in a library file “minor1_lib.py”, are the key components of the Python code.
 
The line “import re” imports a library of Python routines called “re”.

The routine “pattern()” simply sets up the list of key words, separated by the “or” symbol “|”  The characters “+ \” just break up the line so the text is more readable.

The routine “kw_list()” is the one that does all the work.  It looks for the text “pattern” in the string “text”.  For each key word found, it prints out the key word in square brackets, together with 50 characters (“ pad”) on either side.  It also increments the counters “key_wds” and “key_wds_overall” to keep track of how many times each key word appears, both in the current document and in the overall multi-document run.  The “op_f” variable is the address of the output file for results.

Within “kw_list()”, the search is carried out by the  “re.finditer” routine, which produces a list of matches for all the key words found in the current line (“text” in the code).  Each match is saved as the position in the line of the first character and the last character of the keyword.

"pattern" is the list of key words to be searched for (separated by "||").  Same as "k_wds" 

key_words is list of key words actually found while searching current PDF.

key_wds_overall is list of key words actually found while searching all PDFs.
